I couldn't help but notice an irritating lack of indicators which should let you
know if you have begun recording or not. This is a rudimentary attempt at
providing the said feature. A synthesized voice (usually Microsoft Anna) will
inform you when you start or stop recording a scene.

Please note that the plugin requires Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 to be installed on your 
PC. If you are faced with the irritating "MSVCP120.dll is missing from your computer" error 
then please go to http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784 and download 
the correct version depending on the OBS program you use.
