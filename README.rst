An OBS (Open Broadcasting Software) plugin that let's you know when you start or stop recording.

I couldn't help but notice an irritating lack of indicators which should let you
know if you have begun recording or not. This is a rudimentary attempt at
providing the said feature. A synthesized voice (usually Microsoft Anna) will
inform you when you start or stop recording a scene.
